Some parameters are on the meta device because they were offloaded to the cpu.
  0%|          | 0/615 [00:00<?, ?it/s]Starting from v4.46, the `logits` model output will have the same type as the model (except at train time, where it will always be FP32)
You seem to be using the pipelines sequentially on GPU. In order to maximize efficiency please use a dataset
