print()

for i in range(len(table["System"])):
    for key in table:
        if key == "System":

The construction of a wall between Mexico and the United States was a major policy proposal made by Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign. However, the project was met with significant opposition from various groups, including lawmakers, activists, and international organizations.

In 2019, the U.S. government officially abandoned the project, citing cost and feasibility concerns. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has since shifted its focus to other border security measures, such as increased surveillance and personnel deployments.

Additionally, building a wall between the two countries would raise significant legal and constitutional issues, including:

1. Private property rights: The U.S.-Mexico border spans over 1,900 miles, crossing through private properties, national parks, and Native American reservations. Acquiring the necessary land and compensating property owners would be a significant challenge.
2. International law: The construction of a wall could be seen as a violation of international law, particularly the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which established the U.S.-Mexico border after the Mexican-American War.
3. Environmental concerns: The wall would likely harm the environment, including the destruction of habitats and ecosystems, and the disruption of wildlife migration patterns.
